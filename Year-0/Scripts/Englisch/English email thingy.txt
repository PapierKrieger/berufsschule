Dear Mr Stiller,

I am writing to you to let you know the details regarding our scheduled meeting.
The meeting is arranged for friday at 10am, and i would like to invite you to a shared lunch afterwards.
I have prepared a hotel room for the night of friday to saturday at the Sheraton Hotel for you, as there is no available return flight to berlin on friday.

I would ask you to bring any informational material regarding prices and payment / shipment details with you.

Should you be interested i would be happy to see some attractions with you on saturday before your flight.
I can highly recommend the british museum if you are even slightly interested in history,
as it has a plethora of historical artifacts and exhibitions.
Another idea would be to visit some of the well known tourist attractions such as the Tower Bridge or the tower of london.
If you have never been to london they are definitely something any visitor should see.

I am looking forward to meeting you in person!
Should you require anything else from me don't hesitate to ask.

Kind regards,

Sarah Knight
